                    &quot;Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step&period; I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                    things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint&period; They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance&period; The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding&period; It took
                    my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience&period; It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                    developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! &quot;
